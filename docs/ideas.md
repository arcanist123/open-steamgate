# Ideas register

Every idea that was weighed, with what became of it and why. A rejected or
parked idea is not proposed again without a new fact that answers its reason.
Decisions of weight have an ADR (`docs/adr/`); this file is the index and
the short form.

**Status:** `accepted` (decided, being done or next) · `candidate` (wanted,
not scheduled) · `research` (needs a measurement first) · `waiting` (blocked
on someone else) · `parked` (not now, reason given) · `rejected` (not doing,
reason given) · `fun` (for its own sake).

Costs are estimates by the sessions that proposed them, not measurements.

**Order agreed 2026-09-25:** Q1 → Q2 → Q3 → Q6 → B0 → B1. The Q items are built
against a server started by hand; B0 then carries the same extension with
the system inside it.

## Product and editor (ADR 0003)

| id | idea | status | reason / next step |
|---|---|---|---|
| S0 | SAP's ADT for VS Code against our ADT façade | accepted | a test client for the façade (it is Eclipse ADT on a headless Equinox), not our editor; licence read first; 1–2 d spike; same work as the ADT proxy for OSGo |
| B0 | The system is an extension: a VS Code extension carrying the whole system, no separate binary | spike done (#104), packaged as one universal .vsix (#105, #106, #107) | feasibility measured 2026-09-25: runs unchanged on VS Code's Node v24, `node:sqlite`, no native module by default; needs the DB and TLS paths moved out of the working directory; `output/` is 64 MB |
| B7 | adt-express: one small JSON protocol, answered natively here, by the same ABAP classes on a system with the plugin, and by vsp over ADT on a system without it | accepted (spec first) | optimistic writes (`If-Match`, one LUW) remove the need for a session; APC + daemon + AMC only where state is needed |
| B8 | Multiverse of runs: record and replay a dialog step, find where a failing run leaves a passing one, step back in time | candidate | replay via the dialog-step module and the DB seam works on any engine; the path trace needs our own emitter (Go) |
| B11 | Real run variants, harvested and kept: a function module's test data from the SE37 test data directory, a program's selection-screen variants, a class method's run variant as a file beside the class in the repository; each replays as a unit test, a notebook cell, or F8 with the parameters prefilled | candidate | Alice, 2026-09-27: real inputs beat invented ones; the SE37 test data and the variants come from a system through vsp (A4H only, only when asked) |
| B12 | Capture from the debugger: at a breakpoint in a function module, save every current parameter as a test-data record (first in our own SE37 analogue, later exportable into a real system's SE37 test data directory, A4H only and only when asked); in a class method, serialize the whole state (parameters, `me` attributes, referenced objects, deep or shallow) for later tests and replays | candidate | Alice, 2026-09-27; next: a serialization format over the runtime's values and a one-click "save as test" in the DX5 debug session (#135); B11's variants are the same record |
| B13 | Detailed trace with bifurcations, root cause for free: a run's call graph with the parameters of every call and deep or shallow state snapshots, a step backwards from a breakpoint, and two runs compared on the call graph, where the first divergence (which call, which parameter) is the root cause | candidate | Alice, 2026-09-27; extends B8, uses B12's serializer; needs our own emitter (a transpiler hook or OSGo's tracer) |
| B17 | One interception layer at the database seam, owned by the kernel module every host imports (`tools/osd-dialog-step.mjs`): a read or write touching named tables is gated, redirected, traced or failed, with ABAP none the wiser, the way a system's kernel does below ABAP. Consumers: (1) a readiness gate, e.g. the cross-reference tables while they are rebuilt in the background after a cache miss; the gate releases the work-process lock while it waits, as `WAIT` does; (2) the test-double frameworks `CL_OSQL_TEST_ENVIRONMENT`, `CL_CDS_TEST_ENVIRONMENT` and `CL_AMDP_TEST_ENVIRONMENT`, which on a system redirect table and view access to doubles for the length of a unit test, and which neither this tree nor open-abap-core has today; (3) an ST05-like SQL trace, feeding B13; (4) table-buffering emulation; (5) fault injection in tests | candidate | Alice, 2026-09-27. Rule: one owner, and every interception visible (a list of active hooks, a status line, a mark in the trace), so it stays kernel mechanics rather than hidden magic. First consumer: the xref readiness gate (vaporgate's queue); second: the OSQL test environment, measured against A4H first for its exact contract. **Started 2026-09-28:** write hooks only (`hookDatabase`, `activeHooks`, in `tools/osd-dialog-step.mjs`), first used by the ABAP Unit runtime guard (a HARMLESS class that writes fails); reads, redirection and the status line come with the consumers that need them |
| B18 | A reference to compare a case against: the previous local generation first, a real system later. One run envelope (target identity + provenance) shared by all kinds, while each kind keeps its own executor and matcher: OData through the Gateway regression kernel (GW1, an OSG executor path, not a second product), typed RFC for function modules, report list output, ABAP Unit verdicts. The reference identity lives on the case or run; a pack or workspace may only name a default destination, never a host. Cases and baselines come from a system through ADT alone, decoding the cluster tables (the SE37 test data directory, report variants) the way vsp does, so a vanilla reference system needs no Z plug-in; released RFC readers are the fallback where they exist | candidate | Alice and a codex critic, 2026-09-29. First PR: OData GET only, headless, two pinned local generations on separate ports with identically seeded DBs, checked by the generation header, compared by the strict GW matcher; exit 0 equal, 1 difference, 2 error; negative controls mandatory. tools/osd-replay.mjs is ~80% of it but its global date/UUID normalizer is too broad for a baseline. Normalization is per case: exact JSON Pointer masks with a reason, nothing global. Captures and SAP goldens only under .local/, redacted; an offline replay may claim only 'matches the captured snapshot'. Remote writes: allowlist and verified cleanup, never 'rollback'. CI builds its 'before' generation explicitly. The cluster route needs A4H probes that decoded sets and variants match SE37 and the variant screen, failing loudly on a mismatch. Refined the same day (Alice, dell, stoker; three gpt-6-sol xhigh rounds): a case is a plain `.http` file that OSD parses itself (httpYac only an optional adapter), with `# @osd.*` annotations and a sibling golden; a frozen ABAP clock and an ordered UUID sequence per case instead of masks; disposable per-case state instead of a rollback claim; a `.http` CodeLens from URL to the owning DPC method; fiori_automator sessions as reviewed drafts. The plan and its order: `docs/regression-http-cases.md`. Extends B5, B6, B11 |
| B19 | The system starts even when a source is broken, the way a SAP system keeps running the active version while an edit fails to activate. A failed build never blocks Start: the last good generation for the same base serves, and the failing objects show as 'inactive' with a diagnostic on the offending line (e.g. an osg-demo WIP branch using a field the engine's BAL does not have yet). With no previous generation (first start, new base), build without the failing workspace-layer objects and say which were left out; a failure in the base system itself stays a hard stop | candidate | Alice, 2026-09-29. Today the build already leaves the live generation untouched but the extension reports 'build failed' and does not serve it. Offer 'Start last active' and 'Start without workspace layers' as the fallback until the automatic path exists |
| Q1 | Debugger through VS Code's JS debugger and the transpiler's source maps | done (#94) | checked 2026-09-25: 795 maps, mapped per statement to the `.abap` line; relative source paths resolve from the real generation folder |
| Q2 | Thin extension: CodeLens run/call, Test Explorer, generation in the status bar | done (#95, #96 keys, #97 Call EntitySet, #109 test groups) | 2–3 d; abaplint stays the language server |
| Q3 | Readers of a class in CodeLens | done (#98, warm index #103) | 0.5 d; the numbers are in the warm registry |
| Q4 | Dumps as diagnostics on the ABAP line ("Hotspots") | done (#100: ZOSD_DUMP, heat, badges) | 1 d; first step of B8 |
| Q5 | The `osd` MCP server as language-model tools in VS Code | candidate | 0.5 d |
| Q6 | ABAP and SQL notebooks | SQL done (#99); classrun and F9 done (#101); ABAP cells need a scratch layer in the object store | 2–3 d; a cell runs through the warm build (an ABAP cell becomes a throwaway class, 0.5 s), an SQL cell through Open SQL |
| Q7 | SEGW editor and Fiori preview in a VS Code tab | candidate | ~1 d; the pages exist |
| B1 | Tests chosen by the closure of an edit, rerun on save, results inline ("Wallaby for ABAP") | accepted (order 6) | 1–2 weeks |
| B5 | Behaviour of recorded OData requests before and after an edit | candidate | +3–5 d on B1's engine |
| B2 | A sandbox MCP for agents (write, activate, run unit, call OData, SQL, where-used, dumps) | candidate | a real system only as the A4H sandbox, only in throwaway packages, only when asked |
| B6 | The same unit test locally and on a system, a mismatch drafted as an ANORMALIES entry | candidate | same condition as B2 |
| B3 | A real debug adapter on Go | candidate | 3–6 weeks; if Q1 is not enough |
| B4 | ABAP in vscode.dev / Codespaces | candidate | the web variant of B0; waits for the OSGo-in-the-browser wave |
| R6 | Zed extension | parked | mostly a repackaging of Q2/B3; almost no audience |
| R7 | The ADT debugger through our façade | research | long-polling and a stateful debug session: weeks |
| — | ABAP-in-CI product (GitHub Action, hosted checks) | rejected | abaplint's own offering serves CI for ABAP; we build on abaplint |
| — | A codename for the project | rejected | the name stays open-steamgate |
| B10 | The round trip with a real system: pull a package from a system (ADT through vsp, or abapGit), develop it fast in open-steamgate (warm activation, lenses, notebooks, the debugger), push it back (ADT, abapGit, or B7's plugin endpoint) | candidate | Alice, 2026-09-26, in a conversation with SAP developers; the pieces exist (vsp, abapGit zips, the extension); what is missing is the one flow and its conflict story (what changed on the system meanwhile) |
| S1 | abap-fs (the ABAP remote filesystem extension for VS Code, over ADT) against our ADT façade | candidate | like S0 with SAP's own client: a second real ADT client that tells how complete the façade is; measured, not assumed |

## Engines and the hot path (ADR 0004)

| id | idea | status | reason / next step |
|---|---|---|---|
| E1 | Dev loop on JS (Node/Bun, warm), OSGo as the product runtime | accepted | 0.46 s / 0.55 s save to answer; Go's floor is ~1 s plus a restart |
| E2 | Bun + OSGo as the pair when OSGo needs a hot path | accepted | JIT without cgo; both cross-compile to three platforms |
| E3 | IR-JS as a full runtime | parked | 30–45 d for a server ~2× slower than OSGo; stays the oracle |
| E4 | IR-JS hybrid: computation in IR-JS, a bridge to the JS runtime at the by-value seams | candidate | 4–7 d; worth it for a path trace inside the extension |
| E5 | Interpret the emitted Go of an edited class in a running OSGo (yaegi / igop) | research | spike: one class, load time, interface calls both ways |
| E6 | Calls between classes through a registry of slots | research | precondition of any hot swap in Go |
| E7 | Classes loaded as Go plugins, shadowing older ones | research | Linux/macOS only, never unloaded; measure the build time of one plugin |
| E8 | Link without DWARF (`-ldflags=-w`) | research | measure against the 0.5–0.7 s link |
| E9 | Per-class incremental emit + merged IR JSON | accepted | the part of the Go path that is not incremental yet |
| E10 | DIAG and RFC listeners native in OSGo (Go), from the Go code the sibling projects already have (the DIAG tape screen, open-rfc-go) | accepted (backlog) | today the Pi Zero stand runs the JS listeners as a separate Bun binary (81 MB file, ~33 MB RSS); one Go binary should answer HTTP, HTTPS, DIAG and RFC |
| — | V8 inside the Go binary (v8go) | rejected | cgo: per-target C++ toolchains, Windows doubtful, +30–40 MB, still no rebuild without a Go toolchain |
| — | A JS engine compiled to wasm under Go | rejected | no JIT in a wasm guest; goja measured 196 s against 3 s |
| — | abaplint rewritten in ABAP for speed | rejected | ~86,000 lines, a fork of a fast-moving upstream, and ABAP semantics cost speed in Go |

## For its own sake

| id | idea | status | note |
|---|---|---|---|
| F1 | ABAP → MinZ: ABAP on a ZX Spectrum | fun | also a test that the IR is not tied to JS or Go |
| F2 | Numeric kernels of the demo scenes as GLSL shaders | fun | |
| F3 | abaplint's lexer and statement parser compiled from ABAP | fun | a self-hosting test of the compiler (~13,000 lines) |

## Parked elsewhere

- Portable AMDP (pAMDP): parked 2026-09-25; value parity against HANA is the
  first step when it returns (`docs/handover-pamdp-2026-09-24.md`). Declared
  while parked (2026-11-08): the status page says per AMDP method which
  engine runs it (`docs/amdp-engine-status.md`).
- The licence of open-abap-odata: parked (ADR 0003, consequences).

## Tails and small items

Things found along the way that are not ideas of their own: each has the
reason it was noticed and the smallest next step. Status as above.

| id | item | status | reason / next step |
|---|---|---|---|
| T1 | Reuse libraries independently: a transpiled library as its own cached, versioned artefact keyed by its own content; a build transpiles only the upper layers and links the libraries' prebuilt modules | candidate | fast cold builds everywhere (extension first start, CI, fresh clones). Caveat: a module's output depends on the registry it was transpiled in, so an override in a later layer must invalidate the library's dependents (the warm closure knows them). Builds on transpiler `only` (#1900/#1921) |
| T2 | A portable generation hash, so a .vsix can ship a prebuilt generation and the first start is a cache hit (~4 s instead of ~23 s) | done (build), 2026-09-27 | no metadata file was needed: built inside the staged seed, the generation's name is portable (the transpiler there is a plain copy, "published"); an empty pack (the launcher's notebook-scratch) no longer names a generation. Measured the launcher's way: build step 21.7 s -> 0.35 s, first start 35.0 s -> 13.8 s; the ~12 s left are the first boot seeding the database, not the build (docs/vscode-extension.md, Packaging, "T2") |
| T3 | A smaller .vsix (0.1.2: 90.8 MB unpacked, 34.7 MB packed) | done | Default Zork package: 17.7 MiB before, 8.0 MiB after. One solid `seed.tar.br` is unpacked on first start; dependency `.map` files are omitted, while debugger maps are generated in `output/` at first build. See docs/vscode-extension.md, Packaging. |
| T4 | One system identity, read by every client | candidate (nailed to client 123 for now) | the data client is one place already (tools/osd-identity.mjs, OSD_CLIENT, default 123); the ADT client 001 is on purpose (Eclipse projects, the session cookie's name). Expose client/SID/user/language on /osd/serving and ADT discovery; the extension reads the data client from there instead of its MANDT_CLIENT constant |
| T5 | Windows: build/live and output are symlinks, which need admin rights without Developer Mode | accepted | junctions for directories |
| T6 | The Pi Zero stand does not come back after the board reboots | candidate | an @reboot start |
| T7 | Warm build inside the extension's launched system: OSD_WARM when memory allows (≥ 4 GB), Rebuild = warm activation, Full rebuild = cold, "warming up" in the status bar | accepted | the server side (warm state on /osd/serving, a copy fallback when hard links fail) is in progress |
| T8 | The extension's tree grouped by kind (OData / Apps / ICF / APC, later daemons, jobs, transactions); a node is a pointer to its source plus one action; a Launchpad node | accepted | one composing GET route on the server, entity sets lazily from segw/entitysets |
| T9 | An Eclipse-like package tree in the extension, over the ADT façade's own repository/nodestructure routes (one truth with Eclipse) | accepted | check how completely nodestructure expands a class before building on it; adt-express only once its spec exists |
| T10 | "Also serve DIAG/RFC for SAP GUI / Eclipse" in the extension, off by default | candidate (deferred, Alice 2026-09-27) | Eclipse ADT does not take a plain-HTTP connection to our façade: an ABAP Cloud Project needs HTTPS and a service key or OAuth, and an ABAP Project talks ADT over RFC through SAP Logon/JCo, which is what the RFC-to-ADT listener (33nn) is for; the HTTP façade serves this extension, vsp and abap-fs. So the extension starts the DIAG (32nn) and RFC (33nn) listeners from `tools/protocols/` itself. An instance number is a setting, and the ports follow SAP's scheme from it (DIAG 32nn, RFC 33nn, and HTTP 80nn / HTTPS 443nn where used), so SAP Logon entries are simple and they cannot collide with the extension's own HTTP port. If a port is taken, the next free instance number is used and shown. The listeners run with demo authentication, so off by default; the System overview shows the instance, the ports and a ready SAP Logon entry |
| T11 | Smart F8 and a Gateway client: per method, create/update/delete, function imports, $expand, value help | candidate | Q2b covers read only |
| T12 | "Any output": CL_DEMO_OUTPUT (a stub in open-abap-core today), the classic WRITE list, ALV, into the console and notebook cells | candidate | one output sink per run |
| T19 | Data Preview grows into an SE16H/ALV-like viewer (on #112, F8 on a table or CDS view): an SE16H mode with group by columns, aggregates (count, sum, min/max, avg), totals and subtotals; one button hides empty columns, and grouping starts from a column header; quick statistics per column (distinct values, null share, a min/max/histogram sparkline); the current view (filters, grouping, hidden columns) saved as a layout, like an ALV variant; export as TSV, PSV and CSV first, then xlsx, then Parquet | candidate | Alice, 2026-09-27; aggregation runs in the database through Open SQL GROUP BY, the route the SADL runtime already takes for analytics, not in the webview, so it scales; with DuckDB as the engine Parquet export is nearly free |
| T13 | Classic reports through open-abap-gui's converter: ALV untried, dynpro (module pool) not driven, report state lives in process memory so a recycle or a warm swap loses it | candidate | spike #113 runs three examples in webgui and in a VS Code tab |

| T14 | The extension materializes its system per version, so a rebuilt .vsix with the same version reuses a stale copy | accepted | key the materialized copy by the seed's content (a hash written at packaging time), not the version number; found when a same-version reinstall kept a copy without a newly fetched pack |
| T15 | The extension as its own release artifact from this repository: its own version and CHANGELOG, a `vscode-v*` tag that builds the .vsix and attaches it to a GitHub release (later: the marketplace) | accepted | a separate repository only once adt-express makes the extension a client of real systems too; today server and extension change together in almost every PR |
| T16 | An extension icon from the airship sketch (open-steamgate's steam-and-gate): a vector master in SVG, a 128×128 PNG for the marketplace, and a monochrome silhouette for the Activity Bar | candidate | the Activity Bar needs a single-colour SVG; the marketplace icon must be PNG |
| T17 | The system on HANA: the first start (schema + seed over the network) takes ~17 min, and the parent's 60 s readiness timeout gives up before the seed ends | candidate (after the Claude limit resets) | measure where the time goes first (DDL, demo rows, zvdb vectors, taxi facts); batch inserts through one prepared statement; readiness that follows the child's progress instead of a fixed 60 s; a separate, explicit "recreate the schema" step, with an existing schema reused by default |
| T18 | A short "how it works" page for people outside the project: the system runs inside the extension (no ADT connection), what is transpiled, what the debugger shows, how it relates to a real system | candidate | the first question from an SAP developer who saw the demo was "how are you connecting to the transpiled ABAP, ADT?"; README plus the extension's marketplace page |
| T20 | A core without demos: move demo content out of `src/` into packs (`packs/demo`: travel, flight and taxi cubes, photos, the note and test transactions, the AMDP demo; `packs/segw-editor`; `packs/test-examples`: ADT reference objects, regression), so a product build can leave it out | candidate (low priority) | not about size: the movable demo content is ~0.9 MB raw, ~0.19 MiB compressed, while the pack allowlist for the .vsix already takes it from 36.3 to 18.6 MB. Hidden dependents first: the taxi class is imported before demo data is ensured (osd-serve, test/start), stg-compile reads `tools/segw-tables.json` at load, ZSTG_STATUS backs a search help and gateway unit tests, the launchpad and the webgui menu hard-code demo apps and SEGW, ZSTG_SADL_SRV names all three cubes, the release and .vsix smokes call ZSTG_DEMO_SRV. Core stays: gateway, generic SADL/CDS/SEGW generation, webgui shell and transactions, ICF/BSP, status service and app, ADT façade, classrun output. First step: move only the classrun demo class into `packs/demo` and leave it out of the .vsix |
| T21 | An ABAP template engine with a traceable output: Mustache subset, data as ajson, every output line traced to its template line and model path, target-language profiles, probes erased at compile time (`docs/abap-templates.md`) | in progress (`feat/abap-templates`: core, loops, partial arguments, filters, 41 tests) | the shared last step of every generator here and of the generation DSL; abap_mustache measured first (runs, 2 upstream defects found, both fixed upstream); SAP's Code Composer is SAP-internal and untraceable (T22) |
| T22 | The Code Composer (`CMPT`) syntax as a second parser over the T21 core | parked | Alice, 2026-09-30: our syntax first. Measured on A4H with our own templates (54 cases, local corpus) and read off SAP's usage (counts only). Besides a line parser it needs in the core: ABAP-INITIAL truthiness, table sections (first/body/not-last/last), parameterised areas and line glue, none of which the core has as options yet. Return when a task needs SAP templates offline |
