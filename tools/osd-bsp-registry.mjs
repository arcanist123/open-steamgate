// BSP applications in the tree -> a registry the ABAP handler reads.
//
// A `*.wapa.xml` and its pages under an input folder are a BSP application,
// in the shape abapGit writes and a system reads (`docs/a4h-deploy.md`).
// Until now this repository could **make** one and could not **serve** one:
// `webapp/` and every pack were static files behind `express`, which is the
// only place in this tree where the request path is not ABAP, and the reason
// the same artefact did not run in both runtimes.
//
// This is the generator half. It reads the objects and writes
// `gen/bsp/zcl_stg_bsp_registry.clas.abap`, one row per page, the way
// `segw-registry.mjs` writes the service registry. `zcl_osd_bsp` serves them
// on `/sap/bc/ui5_ui5/sap/<app>/<page>`, which is the path a real system
// answers on.
//
// **The bytes do not travel in the class.** They used to: 33 pages became
// 141 KB of chunked base64 inside `zcl_stg_bsp_registry`, which is assets in
// source, a transpile on every image and linear growth per application.
// Alice, on seeing it: "чёто диковатый способ".
//
// The correction that matters is hers as well -- **imitate the interface,
// not the storage.** The first answer to this was a DDIC table, because a
// system keeps pages in `O2PAGELINE`; that is the wrong layer. The pages are
// files in a directory and they stay files in a directory.
//
// So each page becomes a **Web Repository object**, which is the mechanism
// this tree already carries 33 media objects and 16 MB on: a `*.w3mi.xml`
// beside a data file, `WWWDATA_IMPORT` + `SCMS_BINARY_TO_XSTRING` to read
// it, and a host hook (`abap.W3MI_LOADER`) where there is no file system.
// Nothing new is invented, nothing is encoded twice, and the browser preview
// and the compiled binary already know how to answer for it.
//
// Two things to keep straight about that choice:
//
//   - `gen/` is not tracked, so the data files beside the generated objects
//     are a build artefact and not a second copy of `webapp/` that can
//     drift. The source of truth is still the folder the app lives in.
//   - This is how **our** runtime carries the bytes. On a real system the
//     application travels as a BSP application (WAPA, `docs/a4h-deploy.md`)
//     and `/UI5/CL_UI5_HTTP_HANDLER` serves it out of `O2PAGELINE`. W3MI is
//     the local carrier, not a claim about SAP.
