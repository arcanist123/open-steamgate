// A generation: the transpiled system, built to the side, named by what
// went into it, made live by renaming a link.
//
// A build into output/ used to destroy the previous generation before
// succeeding. The serving process survived, but a restart could not.
// Build beside the live generation so a failed save leaves it usable.
//
// Here a build never touches anything that is live. It goes into a
// directory of its own under build/tmp, and only a complete one is renamed
// into build/by-input/<hash>, where <hash> is the sha256 of every input:
// the files in the input folders, the library trees, the config, and which
// transpiler did the work. The same inputs give the same name, so a rebuild
// with nothing changed costs nothing, and a transpiler upgrade is a new
// generation, as it should be. `build/live` is a symlink to the generation
// that serves, and `output/` at the root is a symlink to `build/live/output`,
// so the runtime child, which reads OSD_ROOT/output and nothing else, is
// switched by one rename and knows nothing about any of this.
//
// Content hashing takes 105 ms here, 170 ms for the largest library;
// generations are 44 MB. See docs/generations.md for the design.

 * generations**, unless the binary was compiled from the very generators the

 * to paper over, and the test that asserted equality now asserts what is
 * actually required -- that the two produce the same objects.
