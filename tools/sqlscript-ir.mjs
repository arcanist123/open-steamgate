// This is the IR the splitter lowers (docs/sqlscript-splitter.md). It is
// deliberately written and tested BEFORE any parser exists: twenty fixtures
// built by hand answer "can this model express the semantics" for the cost
// of an afternoon, where finding the same answer after a front end exists
// costs a front end. If the model cannot carry it, nothing downstream can.
//
// Two rules the shape follows, both of them measured rather than preferred:
//
//   1. **An assignment to a table variable is not a barrier.** Measured on
//      HANA Express: a projection that would fail does not fail when a later
//      filter removes the offending row, and the same body does fail under
//      NO_INLINE (docs/sqlscript-hana-observed.md). So a chain of assignments
//      is ONE plan here, not three, and `lower()` must produce one statement.
//
//   2. **Every expression carries the type HANA would give it.** Not for
//      documentation: the lowering cannot choose a form without it. `1/2` is
//      0.5 in DuckDB and 0 in SQLite, so a division node that does not know
//      it is integer division has no correct rendering in either.
//
// Nothing here talks to a database. Lowering is in sqlscript-lower.mjs.

 * either; it turns the join into a self-join and the name exists twice
 * again. The ambiguity moves, it does not go.
 *
 * But a join predicate usually says it outright. `ON a = b` compares one
 * side with the other, so `a` belongs under the left subtree and `b` under
 * the right. That is derivable rather than invented, and where it is not
 * derivable - a self-join on the same column name, a predicate that is not a
 * simple comparison of two columns - nothing is claimed.
